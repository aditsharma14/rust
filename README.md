# Rust Learning Repository

This repository contains simple Rust programs for learning purposes. Each `.rs` file demonstrates a specific language feature or concept. You can compile and run the examples locally, and the code is suitable for uploading to GitHub.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain**: Install from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Ensure `rustc` and `cargo` are available in your PATH.
- On Windows, install the appropriate linker:
  - For the MSVC toolchain, install Visual Studio with the C++ build tools and use a Developer Command Prompt.
  - Alternatively, use the GNU toolchain (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`).

### Compiling and Running

To compile a program, open a terminal in this directory and run:

```sh
rustc filename.rs
./filename       # or `filename.exe` on Windows
```

Or use Cargo with a `Cargo.toml` if you convert this into a full project later.

## Repository Structure

- `hello.rs` - A basic "Hello World" example.
- `conditionals.rs` - Shows usage of conditional statements (if/else).
- Add more files as you learn (loops.rs, functions.rs, etc.).

## Contributing

Feel free to add new examples or improve existing ones. Commit changes with descriptive messages and push to GitHub.

## License

This repository is for personal learning. Feel free to reuse the code but acknowledge the source if sharing.
