# Rust Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Rust programs and examples
created as part of a learning journey with the language. Each file focuses on a
fundamental concept or feature of Rust, making it easier to explore and
experiment.

## Structure

- `hello.rs` – basic "Hello, world!" program.
- `boolean.rs` – examples demonstrating boolean logic and operations.
- `number.rs` – numeric types and arithmetic.
- `string.rs` – working with strings and text.
- `conditionals.rs` – `if`/`else` expressions and decision making.

## Getting Started

1. Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Navigate to this directory and compile a program:
   ```sh
   rustc hello.rs   # produces `hello.exe` on Windows
   ./hello.exe
   ```
3. Alternatively, create a `Cargo.toml` and convert the examples into a Cargo
   project to manage dependencies and build configurations.

## Contributing

Feel free to add more examples or refactor the existing ones. Each file should
be self-contained and focus on a single Rust concept.

## License

This learning repository is released into the public domain. You can use the
examples freely for educational purposes.
